  "body": "### Welcome to AddressBook.jar.\r\nThis is a medium size Java Desktop App you can use as a model/template when developing your own Java Desktop app.\r\n\r\n### Why did we create it?\r\nCreating a Java desktop app requires a developer to figure out many things: the architecture, frameworks to use, release/update mechanisms, etc. These things can take thousands of hours to get right, but once you got them going, they are reusable across other similar projects.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Major Contributions \r\nYou Liang (@yl-coder), Martin Choo (@pjhyett), Hans Adrian (@hansnewbie).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or contact us by [posting a message in our issue tracker](https://github.com/HubTurbo/addressbook/issues/new).\r\n",
